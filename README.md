How to run the project.


Open IBM Quantum Lab:


Log in or sign up for an IBM Quantum account.
Navigate to the IBM Quantum Lab environment.


Run the Code:
Open the Jupyter Notebook file transaction_scheduling.ipynb in the IBM Quantum Lab environment.
Make sure datafiles are stored and accessible. I am not including the data files here but you can create the data synthetically. If required contact me.
It has to be in the same folder as transaction_scheduling file.
Execute the cells in order to train the Quantum Machine Learning model and visualise the results.


Usage Tips:
The code is designed to run in the IBM Quantum Lab environment, leveraging the capabilities of IBM Quantum systems.
Ensure a stable internet connection to access quantum devices and simulators.
Follow the comments in the code for specific instructions.

Troubleshooting:
If encountering issues, check the Python version and ensure all dependencies are installed.
